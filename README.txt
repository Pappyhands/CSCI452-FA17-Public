Overview
Snippet Good is an application being developed by Mark Cohen's Fall 2017 Software Engineering class at MCLA. The current purpose of this program is to display a list of code snippets to users, providing them a central place for their favorite reusable blocks of code. For example, a user might need a snippet of Java code that iterates through a list of names, and organizes them in descending order, returning the reorganized list. Programmers usually resort to search engines to find blocks of code online, but Snippet Good can provide a foundation to keep track of your favorite blocks of code!

This course places teams of students in an agile development environment where they must work together with other teams to build a functional and professional web application, striving to achieve all sprint goals each sprint, and its goal is to leave students with a deeper understanding of agile development.
